# Database Project in Distributed Environments

This project was developed in the second year of my Masterâ€™s program. The goal was to build a Node.js-based web server capable of managing multiple asynchronous connections to heterogeneous data sources, such as SQL/NoSQL databases, APIs and files. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with distributed environments, asynchronous programming and integrating diverse data access methods.
